                    <td> <br> Vis-Ability was founded when we realised that out of the ____ famous scientists included in the QCAA year 11 and 12 curriculum only 1 of them was a female and only ___ were indigenous. 
                        How can we encourage all students to pursue a career that they are passionate about if they can't see themselves in these careers, it is time we change the narrative.
                        So that's where we come in. We hep connect students and educators with these amazing innovators of our past and provide resources to help educators link these amazing stories directly to the curriculum.</td>
